# NGS Asterism Generator and Plate Scale Variation Analysis Tools
This repository hosts Python scripts designed to analyze plate scale variations resulting from non-common path distortions in astronomical instruments. The scripts primarily focus on generating Natural Guide Star (NGS) asterisms and computing plate scale variations for observed stars within the field of view.

## Key Features
NGS Asterism Generation: Utilize the provided function to generate NGS asterisms with customizable parameters such as the number of asterisms and stars per asterism.
Plate Scale Variation Analysis: Compute plate scale variations for observed stars within the field of view, with consideration of the presense of non-common path distortions.

## Dependencies
The project relies on the following Python packages:

- numpy
- matplotlib
- astropy
