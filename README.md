# Optical Design Analyses

## Overview

Welcome to the Optical Design Analyses project repository. This repository aims to provide tools and scripts for conducting thorough analyses in optical design. From understanding wavefront errors to optimizing optical systems, this project seeks to assist researchers, engineers, and enthusiasts in various fields where optical systems play a crucial role.

## Current Status

Currently, the repository hosts scripts for two key aspects of optical design analysis:

- RMS Wavefront Error (WFE) Processing: This script allows for the processing and plotting of Root Mean Square (RMS) wavefront errors. Wavefront error analysis is essential for evaluating the optical performance of systems, and the provided script facilitates this analysis.

- Zernike Polynomials Calculation for Elliptical Aperture: Another script is dedicated to calculating Zernike polynomials for an elliptical aperture. Zernike polynomials are widely used in optical design for representing aberrations, and their calculation for non-circular apertures like ellipses is particularly valuable for many practical applications.
We are actively working on developing new features and expanding the capabilities of this repository. Your feedback, contributions, and suggestions are highly encouraged as we continue to grow and improve this project.

Thank you for your interest in Optical Design Analyses. We look forward to building a comprehensive suite of tools to support your optical design endeavors.
